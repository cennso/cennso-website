introduction:
  title: What is Cennso
  description: >
    **Cennso Cloud** is a cloud-based service that allows users to create network service solutions deployed and managed within their own network topology and using their infrastructure.

    **Cennso Network Solutions** (CNS) are composed of a set of supported infrastructure (IaaS) services typically provided by cloud infrastructure providers, such as AWS, IBM, Equinx Metal, or GCE, and **Cennso Network Functions** (CNFs) implementing the respective network services.

    The composition of these services is based on cloud-native technologies and implemented as a collection of Kubernetes **Custom Resources Definitions** (CRDs) and Operators on top of a distributed topology of Kubernetes clusters.
