## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Type Safety

All code MUST meet these non-negotiable standards:

- TypeScript MUST be used with strict mode enabled (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json)
- ESLint MUST pass without errors (`yarn lint` returns exit code 0)
- Prettier MUST be enforced for consistent formatting (`yarn format` checks)
- No `any` types unless explicitly justified in code comments with `// @ts-expect-error` explanation
- All public functions and components MUST have explicit return type annotations
- All exported interfaces and types MUST be properly documented

**Rationale**: Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves IDE support, and makes refactoring safer. Consistent formatting reduces cognitive load and merge conflicts.

### II. Component Architecture & Reusability

React components MUST follow these architectural patterns:

- Components organized by feature in `/components/[Feature]` or shared in `/components/common`
- Each component file contains ONE primary component (helper components allowed in same file if tightly coupled)
- Props interfaces MUST be explicitly typed and exported when component is exported
- Business logic MUST be extracted to `/lib` utilities or React contexts in `/contexts`
- No direct data fetching in components; use `getStaticProps` at page level
- Shared UI components in `/components/common` MUST be framework-agnostic (no page-specific logic)

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns enables independent testing, reuse across features, and easier maintenance. Next.js SSG pattern requires data fetching at build time.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user-facing features MUST maintain consistent experience:

- Design system: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI components MUST be used; no inline styles or CSS modules
- Responsive design MUST support mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints
- Navigation MUST be consistent across all pages via `createNavigation()` from `lib/navigation.ts`
- SEO metadata MUST be present on every page using `<SEO>` component with title, description, and OG image
- All images MUST use Next.js `<Image>` component with proper width/height and alt text
- Loading states MUST be shown for async operations (forms, data fetching)

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user confusion, improves accessibility, and reinforces brand identity. SEO is critical for discoverability.

### IV. Performance & Build Optimization

Performance requirements that MUST be met:

- All pages MUST use Static Site Generation (SSG) via `getStaticProps` - no client-side data fetching for content
- Images MUST be optimized: WebP format preferred (maximum 150KB per image), proper sizing via Next.js Image optimization
- Bundle size: No single page bundle > 500KB (analyze with `next build`)
- Lighthouse performance score MUST be 100 for production builds
- OG images MUST be auto-generated during build (via `prebuild` script)
- No blocking JavaScript on initial page load; use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Image optimization validated via `yarn perf:images` - all raster images must be WebP format and under 150KB

**Rationale**: Static generation provides fastest load times and best SEO. Performance directly impacts user retention and search rankings.

### V. Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Accessibility MUST be implemented from the start, not retrofitted:

**Keyboard Accessible (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.1 - EN 301 549 Section 9.2.1):**

**Keyboard (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.1 - Level A):**

- All functionality MUST be operable through keyboard alone (no mouse required)
- Interactive elements MUST be keyboard accessible: buttons, links, forms, controls, menus
- Skip links MUST be provided to bypass repetitive navigation ("Skip to main content")
- Custom interactive components MUST have keyboard event handlers (onKeyDown/onKeyPress)
- onClick handlers on non-semantic elements (div/span) MUST include keyboard handler or use role="button"
- Tab order MUST be logical and follow visual flow (avoid positive tabIndex values)
- Focus states MUST be visible on all interactive elements (≥3:1 contrast against adjacent colors)
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:keyboard` validates keyboard handler patterns

**No Keyboard Trap (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.2 - Level A):**

- Users MUST be able to move focus away from any component using only keyboard
- Modals/dialogs MUST allow closing via Escape key
- Focus trapping in modals is acceptable IF user can exit with standard keys (Escape, Tab to close button)
- Positive tabIndex values MUST be avoided (they create unpredictable tab order)
- event.preventDefault() on keyboard events MUST allow Escape key to work
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:keyboard` validates keyboard trap patterns

**Character Key Shortcuts (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.4 - Level A):**

- Single character keyboard shortcuts (e.g., pressing 's' to search) MUST:
  - Require a modifier key (Ctrl/Alt/Cmd), OR
  - Be turn-off-able by the user, OR
  - Only be active when component has focus
- Single letter shortcuts without modifiers interfere with screen readers and typing
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:keyboard` validates single character shortcut patterns

**Focus Management:**

- Focus MUST move to meaningful content after navigation
- Modal open: Focus MUST move to first interactive element or modal itself
- Modal close: Focus MUST return to trigger element
- Delete action: Focus MUST move to next logical element
- Keyboard traps MUST be avoided (users can always escape modals, menus, etc.)
- Material-Tailwind Menu components have built-in keyboard support
- Headless UI Dialog components have built-in Escape key handling

**Enough Time (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.2 - EN 301 549 Section 9.2.2):**

**Timing Adjustable (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.2.1 - Level A):**

- Time limits MUST be adjustable - users can:
  - Turn off the time limit before encountering it, OR
  - Adjust the time limit before encountering it (at least 10x default), OR
  - Extend the time limit before it expires (at least 20 seconds warning, extend at least 10x with simple action)
- Exceptions allowed for:
  - Real-time events (e.g., auctions) where timing is essential
  - Time limits over 20 hours
- Session timeouts MUST warn users before expiration and allow extension
- Forms with time limits MUST preserve data when time expires
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:enough-time` validates setTimeout/setInterval patterns

**Pause, Stop, Hide (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.2.2 - Level A):**

- Auto-playing content (moving, blinking, scrolling) that:
  - Starts automatically, AND
  - Lasts more than 5 seconds, AND
  - Is presented in parallel with other content
- MUST provide mechanism to pause, stop, or hide
- Applies to: Carousels, slideshows, auto-scrolling news tickers, animations
- Exceptions: Content that is essential (e.g., real-time status updates)
- UI animations/transitions under 5 seconds are acceptable
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:enough-time` validates auto-playing patterns

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- Use debouncing/throttling for performance (acceptable pattern)
- Loading state delays under 5 seconds (acceptable pattern)
- Modal close animations (acceptable pattern)
- Avoid session timeouts when possible
- If session timeout required: Warn 2 minutes before expiration, allow extension
- Auto-playing carousels MUST have pause button (visible and keyboard accessible)
- Auto-updating content (news feeds, stock tickers) MUST have pause/stop control

**Seizures and Physical Reactions (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.3 - EN 301 549 Section 9.2.3):**

**Three Flashes or Below Threshold (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.3.1 - Level A):**

- Content MUST NOT flash more than 3 times per second (333ms threshold)
- Applies to: Flashing, blinking, or strobing content
- No content should have rapid opacity/visibility changes that could trigger seizures
- Video content MUST be checked for flashing sequences before publishing
- Animations with rapid state changes MUST be avoided
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:seizures` validates animation durations and flash patterns

**Animation from Interactions (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.3.3 - Level AAA - Best Practice):**

- Motion animations triggered by interactions SHOULD respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Users with vestibular disorders can disable animations in OS settings
- All CSS animations SHOULD check `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- When reduced motion is preferred: Disable or reduce animations
- Safe alternatives: Fade opacity, reduce duration, use static positioning
- **Implementation**: Added to `styles/tailwind.css` for all animations
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:seizures` validates prefers-reduced-motion support

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- All @keyframes animations MUST respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Smooth transitions and slow animations are safe (orbital rotations, scrolling logos)
- Never use rapid flashing/blinking effects for any purpose
- Test animations at different speeds to ensure safety
- Framer Motion and CSS transitions automatically respect user preferences
- Orbital animations (partners page) disabled when prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
- Logo scrolling animations disabled when prefers-reduced-motion: reduce

**Navigable (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.4 - EN 301 549 Section 9.2.4):**

**Bypass Blocks (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.1 - Level A):**

- Mechanism MUST be provided to bypass blocks of repeated content
- Skip links OR semantic landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) satisfy this requirement
- Layout component wraps all pages with `<main>` element (implicit bypass mechanism)
- Pages with navigation MUST use Layout component or provide skip link
- Skip link pattern: `<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>` as first focusable element
- Alternative: Use semantic HTML5 landmarks for screen reader navigation
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` validates Layout usage and landmark presence

**Page Titled (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.2 - Level A):**

- All pages MUST have descriptive page titles that identify the topic or purpose
- Title format: `{page.title} | {siteMetadata.title}` (handled by `<SEO>` component)
- Landing page can use default title (siteMetadata.title only)
- Page titles MUST NOT be generic (e.g., "Untitled", "Page", "New Page")
- `<SEO>` component MUST be used on every page with `title` prop
- Title should describe page content and help users navigate via browser tabs/bookmarks
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` validates SEO component usage and title props

**Focus Order (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.3 - Level A):**

- Focus order MUST follow logical sequence (typically DOM order)
- Positive `tabIndex` values (tabIndex > 0) MUST NOT be used (disrupts natural order)
- Only use `tabIndex={0}` (include in tab order) or `tabIndex={-1}` (exclude from tab order)
- Modal dialogs MUST use `aria-modal` or `role="dialog"` for focus management
- Complex components SHOULD follow natural left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` detects positive tabIndex values

**Link Purpose (In Context) (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.4 - Level A):**

- Link purpose MUST be clear from link text alone or from link text + context
- Avoid generic link text: "click here", "read more", "here", "more", "link"
- Use descriptive text: "View success story", "Download report", "Contact sales team"
- Icon-only links MUST have `aria-label` or `title` attribute
- Links with images MUST have descriptive `alt` text on the image
- Same destination links SHOULD have consistent link text across the site
- Example: `<Link href="/contact" aria-label="Contact us">` for icon-only links
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` validates link text and icon-only links

**Multiple Ways (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.5 - Level AA):**

- More than one way MUST be provided to locate pages within the site
- Required mechanisms: Navigation menu + at least one of:
  - Sitemap (`sitemap.xml` at root, generated by `next-sitemap`)
  - Search functionality
  - Breadcrumbs on sub-pages (PageHeader component)
- Current implementation:
  - ✓ Navigation menu (Navigation.tsx, createNavigation())
  - ✓ Sitemap (sitemap.xml, auto-generated)
  - ✓ Breadcrumbs (PageHeader component with breadcrumbs prop)
- Exceptions: Pages that are steps in a process (e.g., checkout flow)
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` validates PageHeader breadcrumbs usage

**Headings and Labels (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.6 - Level AA):**

- Headings MUST describe topic or purpose clearly
- Form labels MUST describe input controls clearly
- Headings MUST NOT be empty or use placeholder text ("Heading", "Title", "TBD")
- Form labels MUST NOT be empty or use placeholder text ("Label", "Field")
- Headings describe sections; labels describe form controls
- Use descriptive text or JSX expressions that resolve to descriptive content
- PageHeader component provides `<h1>` automatically with page title
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` validates heading and label content (allows JSX expressions)

**Focus Visible (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.7 - Level AA):**

- Keyboard focus indicator MUST be visible on all interactive elements
- `outline: none` MUST be replaced with alternative focus styles (ring, border, shadow)
- Focus indicators MUST have ≥3:1 contrast ratio against background (validated by `yarn a11y:contrast`)
- Acceptable patterns:
  - Use `focus-visible:` pseudo-class for keyboard-only focus styles
  - Provide custom focus styles with `ring-*`, `border-*`, or `shadow-*` classes
  - Tailwind: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500 focus:outline-none`
- DaisyUI and Material-Tailwind components have built-in focus styles
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:navigable` detects `outline: none` without alternatives

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- All pages MUST use `<SEO title="..." description="..." />`
- Sub-pages SHOULD use `<PageHeader breadcrumbs={[...]} />`
- Use Next.js `<Link>` component (provides proper keyboard support)
- Icon-only links: `<Link href="..." aria-label="descriptive text">`
- Breadcrumbs provide secondary navigation (Multiple Ways requirement)
- Semantic landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) in Layout.tsx
- Layout component ensures consistent bypass mechanism across all pages
- Focus order follows natural DOM order (no positive tabIndex)
- Headings use descriptive content from page frontmatter/YAML
- Form labels always paired with inputs using `htmlFor`/`id`

**Input Modalities (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.5 - EN 301 549 Section 9.2.5):**

**Pointer Gestures (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.1 - Level A):**

- Multi-point gestures (pinch-zoom, two-finger scroll) MUST have single-pointer alternatives
- Path-based gestures (swipe, drag) MUST have simple pointer alternatives
- Touch events with `touches.length > 1` MUST provide `onClick` or button alternatives
- Drag-and-drop MUST have keyboard alternatives (cut/paste, arrow keys, buttons)
- Canvas/SVG interactions MUST provide click/tap alternatives
- Progressive enhancement: Touch events can enhance but not replace basic interaction
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:input-modalities` validates multi-touch patterns

**Pointer Cancellation (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.2 - Level A):**

- Actions MUST trigger on up-event (`onClick`, `onPointerUp`), NOT down-event
- `onMouseDown`/`onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` MUST NOT trigger significant actions
- Users MUST be able to abort actions by moving pointer away before release
- Exceptions: Emulating keyboard (piano keys), essential down-event actions
- React's `onClick` uses up-event by default (safe pattern)
- Down-events acceptable for: Focus, hover states, visual feedback only
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:input-modalities` validates down-event action patterns

**Label in Name (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.3 - Level A):**

- Accessible name (aria-label, aria-labelledby) MUST contain visible label text
- Voice input users speak visible labels to activate controls
- If button shows "Submit", aria-label should be "Submit" or "Submit form"
- Mismatch between visible and accessible names causes voice control failures
- Best practice: Use visible text as label, add aria-label only if needed for context
- Form labels: Visible `<label>` text MUST match or be contained in `aria-label`
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:input-modalities` validates label text matching

**Motion Actuation (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.4 - Level A):**

- Device motion/orientation APIs MUST have UI control alternatives
- Shake-to-undo MUST have button alternative
- Tilt-to-scroll MUST have traditional scroll
- Motion actuation MUST be disableable to prevent accidental triggers
- Exceptions: Motion is essential (e.g., pedometer app)
- devicemotion, deviceorientation, accelerometer, gyroscope need alternatives
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:input-modalities` validates motion event listeners

**Target Size (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.5 - Level AAA - Best Practice):**

- Interactive targets SHOULD be ≥44×44 CSS pixels
- Applies to: Buttons, links, form controls, touch targets
- Mobile guideline: 48×48dp (≈44×44 CSS pixels)
- Exceptions: Inline links in text, essential small targets
- Tailwind/DaisyUI default button sizes meet this requirement
- Icon buttons: Ensure adequate padding (p-2 minimum for touch targets)
- Level AAA (best practice): Informational only, not enforced

**Concurrent Input Mechanisms (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.5.6 - Level AAA - Best Practice):**

- DON'T restrict input to single modality (touch-only, mouse-only)
- Users SHOULD be able to switch between input methods freely
- DON'T detect touch and disable mouse, or vice versa
- Input method detection SHOULD NOT restrict functionality
- Progressive enhancement: Add touch support without removing mouse/keyboard
- Level AAA (best practice): Informational only, not enforced
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:input-modalities` validates input restriction patterns

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- Use React's `onClick` for all actions (safe up-event pattern)
- Avoid `onMouseDown`, `onTouchStart` for triggering state changes
- Icon-only buttons: Provide aria-label matching visible tooltip/icon meaning
- Voice control: Match visible text in accessible names
- Multi-touch: Progressive enhancement only, never required for functionality
- Drag-and-drop: Implement keyboard alternatives (Material-Tailwind DnD does this)
- Motion APIs: Always provide UI controls for same functionality
- Target sizes: Use TailwindCSS classes that ensure adequate touch targets
- Test with: Voice control (Voice Control on iOS/macOS, Voice Access on Android)

**Readable (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 3.1 - EN 301 549 Section 9.3.1):**

**Language of Page (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.1.1 - Level A):**

- Primary language of page MUST be specified with `lang` attribute on `<html>` element
- Use valid BCP 47 language tags (e.g., `en`, `en-US`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `ja`)
- Screen readers use `lang` to select correct pronunciation rules and accent
- In Next.js: Set in `pages/_document.tsx` on `<Html lang="en">` component
- Current implementation: `<Html lang="en">` in \_document.tsx ✓
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:readable` validates lang attribute presence and format

**Language of Parts (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.1.2 - Level AA):**

- Text passages in different languages MUST be marked with `lang` attribute
- Applies to: Quotes, foreign phrases, mixed-language content
- Inline foreign text: `<span lang="fr">Bonjour</span>`
- Block foreign text: `<blockquote lang="de">...</blockquote>`
- Exceptions: Proper names, technical terms, words that became part of the language
- Examples: "café" (common in English), "JavaScript" (technical term)
- Manual review recommended for multilingual content
- **Automated**: `yarn a11y:readable` provides guidance (difficult to fully automate)

**Unusual Words (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.1.3 - Level AAA - Best Practice):**

- Jargon, idioms, slang SHOULD have definitions or glossary available
- Technical terms SHOULD be explained on first use

- Content SHOULD not exceed lower secondary education reading level
- When complex text required: Provide supplementary simplified version
- Exceptions: Technical/professional content (developer docs, legal text)
- Best practices:
  - Use short sentences and paragraphs
  - Prefer common words over complex ones
  - Use active voice ("We recommend" vs "It is recommended")
  - Break complex ideas into steps
- Level AAA (informational): Apply to marketing/user-facing content

**Pronunciation (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.1.6 - Level AAA - Best Practice):**

- Ambiguous pronunciation words SHOULD have guidance
- Relevant for: Proper names, heteronyms (read/read, live/live)
- Use `<ruby>` annotations for pronunciation: `<ruby>漢字<rt>かんじ</rt></ruby>`
- Level AAA (informational): Mainly for linguistic/educational content

**Predictable (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 3.2 - EN 301 549 Section 9.3.2):**

**On Focus (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.2.1 - Level A):**

- Focusing an element MUST NOT cause a change of context (navigation, form submit, open new windows)
- Use `onFocus` only for visual hints (styling, tooltips) and avoid triggering actions
- Automated: `yarn a11y:predictable` validates common focus handlers that perform navigation or submission

**On Input (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.2.2 - Level A):**

- Changing a control (select, checkbox, radio) MUST NOT automatically change context unless the user is warned beforehand
- If auto-submit or navigation is necessary, provide explicit label/instruction ("Selecting an option will submit the form")
- Prefer explicit action controls ("Submit") rather than implicit onChange submissions

**Consistent Navigation (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.2.3 - Level AA):**

**Error Prevention (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.3.4 - Level AA):**

- For legal, financial, or data-submission forms, provide review/confirm steps and prevent accidental submissions
- Avoid auto-submit on input change without clear prior warning

**Testing & Validation (Input Assistance):**

- Automated: `yarn a11y:input-assistance` MUST pass (flags missing labels, missing error regions, auto-submit patterns)
- Manual: Verify error messages are announced by screen readers and input elements are focused when errors occur

**Distinguishable (WCAG 2.1 Guideline 1.4 - EN 301 549 Section 9.1.4):**

**Use of Color (WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.1):**

**Implementation Requirements:**

- All new image/icon components MUST follow established patterns
- Social share buttons MUST use platform-specific aria-labels

- **Landmark Elements**: All pages MUST use semantic HTML5 landmarks
  - `<main>` MUST wrap primary page content (exactly one per page)
  - `<nav>` MUST wrap navigation regions
  - `<footer>` MUST wrap footer content
  - `<header>` for page/section headers

- CSS positioning/flexbox/grid MUST NOT create illogical tab order
- Content MUST be understandable when stylesheets are disabled

**Automated Validation:**

- Semantic structure validation with `yarn a11y:semantic` MUST pass with zero errors and zero warnings
- Script validates: heading hierarchy, landmarks, form labels, table structure
- Generic component libraries (e.g., `Form.tsx`) are excluded from validation as they receive proper labels when used

**Media & Animation:**

- Animations MUST respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for users with vestibular disorders
- Auto-playing animations longer than 5 seconds MUST have pause/stop controls

**ARIA Best Practices:**

- Use native HTML elements over ARIA when possible (e.g., `<button>` not `<div role="button">`)
- ARIA attributes MUST be used correctly (invalid ARIA is worse than no ARIA)
- Avoid redundant ARIA (e.g., `<nav role="navigation">` is redundant)

**Testing & Validation:**

- Manual keyboard navigation testing MUST be performed for interactive features
- Screen reader testing SHOULD be performed (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS/iOS)
- Browser zoom testing up to 200% MUST be performed for new pages/components
- Responsive testing at 320px viewport width MUST be performed
- Text alternatives MUST be verified for all new images, icons, and interactive elements

- Color alone MUST NOT convey information (verify with grayscale filter)
- Tab order and focus flow MUST be tested with keyboard only navigation
- Modal focus trapping MUST be tested (focus stays in modal, Escape to close)
- Session timeouts MUST be tested (if applicable) - verify warning and extension mechanisms
- Auto-playing content MUST be tested - verify pause/stop controls work
- Animations MUST be tested with OS reduced motion setting enabled
- Video content MUST be checked for flashing sequences (3+ flashes per second)
- Page titles MUST be verified for descriptiveness (check browser tabs)

- Language attribute MUST be verified in \_document.tsx (`lang="en"` or appropriate)
- Foreign language passages SHOULD have `lang` attribute (manual review)
- Content clarity SHOULD be reviewed for reading level (aim for simplicity)

**Rationale**: Accessibility is both a legal requirement (ADA, Section 508, EU Accessibility Act/EN 301 549) and moral imperative. Building accessibility in from the start is 10x easier than retrofitting. Approximately 15% of the global population has some form of disability. Automated testing catches ~40% of accessibility issues; manual testing is essential. WCAG 2.1 Principle 2 (Operable) fully automated (5/5 guidelines), Principle 3 (Understandable) started (1/3 guidelines) - ~82% of Level AA coverage achieved.

## Content Management Standards

Content architecture requirements:

- All content MUST be in `/content` directory: YAML for structured data, MDX for long-form content
- Authors MUST be defined in `content/authors.yaml` with unique IDs before being referenced
- Blog posts MUST use MDX format in `content/blog-posts/` with required frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `authors`, `category`, `excerpt`, `cover`
- **UI Text Externalization**: All user interface text (labels, messages, status text) MUST be sourced from YAML files in `/content` directory, never hardcoded in components
- Asset paths MUST be absolute from `/public` directory (e.g., `/assets/image.png`)
- All assets (images, avatars, icons) MUST have descriptive filenames reflecting their content
- Image alt text MUST be descriptive and contextual
- Link validity MUST be checked via `lychee.toml` configuration before merging PRs
- Hot reload does NOT work for content changes; manual browser refresh required during development

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates

Before any PR can be merged, ALL of the following MUST pass:

1. **Build**: `yarn build` completes without errors
2. **Lint**: `yarn lint` returns no errors
3. **Format**: `yarn format` shows no formatting violations
4. **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
5. **Accessibility**: `yarn a11y` passes all WCAG 2.1 AA checks:
   - Contrast ratios (`yarn a11y:contrast`)
   - Text alternatives (`yarn a11y:text-alternatives`)
   - Time-based media (`yarn a11y:media`)
   - Semantic structure (`yarn a11y:semantic`)
   - Distinguishable content (`yarn a11y:distinguishable`)
   - Keyboard accessible (`yarn a11y:keyboard`)
   - Enough time (`yarn a11y:enough-time`)
   - Seizures prevention (`yarn a11y:seizures`)
   - Navigable (`yarn a11y:navigable`)
   - Input modalities (`yarn a11y:input-modalities`)
   - Readable (`yarn a11y:readable`)

**Recommended Pre-commit Command**: `yarn check:all` (runs format, lint, a11y [11 checks], and build in sequence)

**Automated Quality Checks**: GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`) enforces all quality gates on pull requests

### Testing Policy

When tests are introduced, they MUST use the following technology stack:

- **Integration/E2E Tests**: Playwright for end-to-end user journeys and critical flows
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for utility functions in `/lib` and isolated logic
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for component behavior validation
- **Visual Regression**: (Future) Chromatic or Percy for UI consistency checks

Test organization requirements:

- Test files MUST be in `/tests` directory
- Integration tests MUST cover: form submissions, navigation flows, content rendering
- Unit tests MUST cover: markdown parsing, navigation generation, data transformations
- Test coverage target: >80% for new utility code in `/lib`
